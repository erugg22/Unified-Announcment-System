From the fall of 2019 to the spring of 2020, I was a member of Syosset High School's Technology Committee. There, I worked on coding a system of synchronized digital bulletin boards, or Google Slides, as the school's announcement system was disorganized and inefficient. My team and I constructed a workflow that demonstrated the life cycle of a visual announcement (which would be displayed on the new TV multicast system other hardware-focused members of the committee were working to implement). The workflow involved a visual announcement enduring several stages of approval, including approval from the school's student committee and the school administration. At any stage in the process, the announcement can be rejected and sent back to the requester.
My role in this project was coding the approval system. This involved not only the Google slides approval ladder, but also the communication between Google Slides and Google Sheets to keep track of announcement submissions (information of requester, time of request, etc.). I coded this in Google Apps Script, which is essentially the same as JavaScript.
